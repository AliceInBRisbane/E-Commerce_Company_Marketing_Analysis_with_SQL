# E-Commerce Company Marketing Analysis

This repository contains a set of SQL queries and analytical procedures used to evaluate the performance of various marketing channels and website optimization tests for an e-commerce company. The goal of this analysis is to provide insights into traffic trends, conversion rates, revenue impacts, and the performance of marketing campaigns.

## Project Overview

The SQL queries in this repository are designed to analyze website sessions, order data, and marketing campaigns, particularly those from **Gsearch** (Google Search). The key areas of focus include:

- Monthly Trends Analysis for Gsearch Sessions and Orders
- Brand vs. Nonbrand Campaign Performance
- Device Type Impact on Conversion for Nonbrand Campaigns
- Traffic Trends from Different Marketing Channels
- Conversion Rate Trends Over Time
- Revenue Estimation from Gsearch Landing Page Test
- Full Conversion Funnel Analysis for Landing Page Tests
- Impact Analysis of Billing Page Test

## Project Setup

### Database Setup

The analysis assumes the existence of the following tables in a MySQL database:

- `website_sessions`
- `orders`
- `website_pageviews`

Ensure your database contains these tables and relevant data before running the queries.

### SQL Queries

Each SQL query in this repository addresses a specific marketing analysis requirement. Below is a brief description of each section:

#### 1. Monthly Trends for Gsearch Sessions and Orders

Tracks the number of sessions and orders attributed to **Gsearch** over time, calculating conversion rates for each month.

### 4. Traffic Trends from Multiple Marketing Channels
Compares Gsearch with other marketing channels to assess the traffic volume and conversion impact from each source.

### 5. Conversion Rate Trends Over Time
Tracks the conversion rate (sessions to orders) month over month to identify improvements or declines in website performance.

### 6. Revenue Estimation from Gsearch Landing Page Test
Analyzes the impact of a landing page test by estimating revenue based on incremental conversion rates.

### 7. Full Conversion Funnel for Landing Page Tests
Visualizes the full conversion funnel from landing page views to final order completion, segmented by user actions.

### 8. Impact Analysis of Billing Page Test
Quantifies the revenue lift generated by a billing page test and tracks the number of sessions for the past month.
